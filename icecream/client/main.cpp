 *
 * There are three methods of use for distcc: explicit (distcc gcc -c
 * foo.c), implicit (distcc -c foo.c) and masqueraded (gcc -c foo.c,
 * where gcc is really a link to distcc).
 *
 * Detecting these is relatively easy by examining the first one or
 * two words of the command.  We also need to make sure that when we
 * go to run the compiler, we run the one intended by the user.
 *
 * In particular, for masqueraded mode, we want to make sure that we
 * don't invoke distcc recursively.
