Release Critical:
* keep better track of currently installing daemons (matz)
* daemon: drop root rights before doing anything with client data (coolo)
* bind the broadcast listener to fixed local port (8765) (otherwise not firewallable)
* put the $bindir in config.h, so that create-env can be called without $PATH
* chmod TMPDIR/native, as otherwise set umask prevent it from being readable by the client
   I'm wondering if it doesn't make sense to leave the daemon out of the game and let the
   client package the environment - it could either cache it in /tmp and leave a note in
   ~/.icecream or it packages it right into ~/.icecream and use e.g. the inode numbers of
   the compilers to verify it's the right environment - think NFS users changing machines.
   This would simplify some things and avoid the above bugs (and it would make it more
   convenient for users of /opt/gcc-cvs/bin too)
* Improve Documentation (cschum)

Dream Mode:
* daemon: run without chroot rights (not sure it's worth it)
      as we can't overwrite the ld-linux.so, we would need to call all binaries ourselves.
      E.g. PATH=/ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib lib/ld-linux.so usr/bin/gcc -print-prog-name=cc1
        parse that output and use it for -B
      PATH=/ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib lib/ld-linux.so usr/bin/gcc -B $basepath -v test.ii -finvalid-opt
        parse that output and use the command line used (remove -pipe from the options)
      E.g.
      lib/ld-linux.so $basepath/cc1plus -fpreprocessed test.ii -quiet -dumpbase test -auxbase test -version -o test.s
      ... you figured here it's just too ugly to be worth it
  - another way might be to require libelf and patch the binaries 

Random:
* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware
* If someone calls a amd64 client on a host that runs a ia32 daemon and there are
  no other amd64 daemons in the farm, he will get no answer, but a timeout from
  scheduler (quite a corner case, but neat)
* better support for gcc installations not in /usr - for example in allowing the distcc way
  icecc /opt/gcc-cvs/bin/g++ -c test.cpp (you would need to rely on $ICECC_VERSION then as
  the daemon can hardly know what compiler you used, but that should be ok)
