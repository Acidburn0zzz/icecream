* daemon: install and use build root
   as user: (not sure it's worth it)
      chown 0 lib/libc.so*
      PATH=$PWD/usr/bin LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib:/lib usr/bin/gcc -B/tmp/test/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse-linux/3.3.1/ -c ~/test.ii
* monitor: easier monitor views
* client: let the client have run the job on two different servers for every 10th or 100th job
* all: protocol version
* scheduler: If ICECC_VERSION isn't set at all the client is confused,
  because the scheduler returns with 'false' in got_env (because it doesn't
  yet handle the catch-all environment), but, well, ICECC_VERSION isn't set ;)
* daemon/client: register the system compiler with <uname>-<gcc version> and if a client compiles
  without ICECC_VERSION, let the daemon package the environment. This way, the user doesn't
  need to setup anything
* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware
