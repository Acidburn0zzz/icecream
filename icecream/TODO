* monitor: easier monitor views
* client: let the client have run the job on two different servers for every 10th or 100th job
* all: protocol version
* scheduler: If ICECC_VERSION isn't set at all the client is confused,
  because the scheduler returns with 'false' in got_env (because it doesn't
  yet handle the catch-all environment), but, well, ICECC_VERSION isn't set ;)
