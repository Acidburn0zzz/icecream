* daemon: install and use build root
   as user: 
      chown 0 lib/libc.so*
      PATH=$PWD/usr/bin LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib:/lib usr/bin/gcc -B/tmp/test/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse-linux/3.3.1/ -c ~/test.ii
* client: if the is interrupted, remove the job from the CS
* if the client is cancelled, there might be jobs that reside in the joblist
  even though the daemon never heared of them - timeout!
* Netname to have DEBUG and REAL (Matz)
* watch the binary and restart the daemon (Coolo)
* easier monitor views

IDEAS:
* provide a way to pass jobs through the scheduler for multihomed servers
